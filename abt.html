				 <h2>ABOUT US</h2> 
				<p> 
				Privé. An adjective, a word borrowed from French which means private, secret, quiet or silent. <br><br>
Wherever we go these days, we hear all kinds of noises coming from dogs, cats, vehicles, construction, and any other form 
of noise you can think of. For those who need to focus on work or school, this is one of their major concerns. Regardless 
of age, everyone can become stressed out by unwanted noise.<br><br> As a result, Privé Café will be a haven for people who 
are seeking privacy and silence. Private, soundproof rooms are provided at Privé Café. These peaceful, haven-like rooms are 
perfect for anyone who wants to work, study, attend meetings, or simply just relax. <br><br> Time is indeed gold. Many people 
are constantly preoccupied with their jobs and do not have time to take long breaks. For on-site workers, queuing up at a store 
for a break is inconvenient and wastes time. We, at Privé Café, took that into consideration when we developed this reservation 
website for them. Customers can simply reserve their orders online and pick them up at the store when they are ready rather than 
waiting in line. Many of our customers will be able to spend their time on more important activities. Furthermore, Privé Café provides 
customers the utmost quality services and serves them with excellent products.<br><br> We hope that in the future, Privé Café will be 
renowned as a high-quality company that assists customers in saving valuable energy and time.
